# TWRP Device tree for Galaxy M02s.
<hr>

## Yeah, we all know Galaxy M02s is such a shit device. Can't even rooth with magisk. Damn bootloops. btw I successfully compiled TWRP form source and it booted in M02s. But the only bug is touch screen is not working.

## You might be able to use an USB OTG to deal with the recovery.

## I'm sure, the only bug is the touch screen and it won't give you any mount errors cuz I already compiled the twrp with correct partition values.
